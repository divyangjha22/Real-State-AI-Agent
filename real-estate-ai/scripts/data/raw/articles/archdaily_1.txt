The first photos of the recently completed Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport (WSI) have just been unveiled, marking the delivery of Australia's first major airport in over half a century. Designed through a collaborative process by Zaha Hadid Architects and COX Architecture, and delivered by Woods Bagot and Multiplex, the terminal presents a new model for airport design, one that is grounded in its setting, responsive to its context, and oriented toward the future of travel. Located in Badgerys Creek on the Cumberland Plain, the terminal is positioned to serve as a long-term gateway to Greater Sydney. While major construction has concluded, final fit-outs of the terminal's retail precinct and airline lounges will be completed closer to the airport's official launch, as commercial agreements continue to progress. Western Sydney International Airport is on track to begin operations, including domestic, international, and air cargo services, in late 2026.
